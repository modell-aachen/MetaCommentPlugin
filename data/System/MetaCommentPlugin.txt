%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

This is YACS (yet another comment system) which tries to

   * (a) be easy to use,
   * (b) scale up to lots of comments
   * (c) provide different layouts and commenting requirements and
   * (d) implement a moderation workflow for comments before they go live.

<nop>%TOPIC% allows to easily add commenting to any topic. Discussiosn can
either be displayed in linear or threaded mode. Different comment styles and
layouts can easily be created and switched from one to the other.  Comments can
be edited and deleted inline easily.  Commenting can be enabled independently
from the normal change access rights to a topic while they are still stored as
meta data to a topic. That way a keyword search matching on different comments
of the same discussion will generate a hit on the discussion itself in a
natural way.

---++ Data Model

Each comment is stored into a =META:COMMENT= field of a topic with properties

   * name: id of the comment, used in =ref= for threaded comments
   * author: !WikiName of the author of this comment
   * date: timestamp when this comment was created
   * modified: timestamp when this comment was last modified 
   * ref: name of another comment within the same thread this comment is a subcomment of
   * text: the comment text
   * title: title text of this comment

---++ Configuring the comment system

---+++ Using !MetaCommentPlugin on !NatSkin
The easiest way to switch on commenting on a page is when using it together with Foswiki:Extensions/NatSkin.
When opening the topic editor, there's a "Settings" tab that allows you to switch on and off commenting,
switch between different commenting styles as well as configure moderation.

---+++ Using !MetaCommentPlugin on !PatternSkin
On a standard !PatternSkin install you will have to use preference variables to control the system.
First, to enable commenting add the =metacomment= skin overlay to your =SKIN= variable in %LOCALSITEPREFS%.

<verbatim>   * Set SKIN = metacomment, pattern</verbatim>

To display the comment interface like shown above you need to set the preference variable:

<verbatim>   * Set DISPLAYCOMMENTS = on</verbatim>

There are a couple of formats how comments are displayed on the topic:

<verbatim>   * Set COMMENTFORMAT = threaded</verbatim>

Other values: 
   * linear: list comments in linear order, i.e. there are no replies to comments directly
   * threaded (default): nested commenting; allows to reply on a reply
   * reverse: list comments in linear order in reverse twitter-like fashion
   * insidetab: list comments inside a tab at the bottom of the page; 
     only available when used together with Foswiki:Extensions/TopicInteractionPlugin)

A discussion can be either open or closed:

<verbatim>   * Set COMMENTSTATE = open</verbatim>

By setting this to =closed= comments gathered so far are still listed while the form to add more comments is hidden

These preferences can of course be set per topic or added to the WebPreferences in case you want to enable commenting
on all of the web.

---+++ Permissions

!MetaCommentPlugin separaters permission to comment on a topic from plain change access rights of a topic.
That way you may restrict write access to a topic while still open it up for commenting to a wider audience.
This is done by using a separate =COMMENT= access control list. Given the current topic is write restricted only
allowing the original author to make changes, the following setting will permit commenting:

<verbatim>   * Set ALLOWTOPICCOMMENT = <comma separated list of users and/or groups></verbatim>

See [[System.AccessControl][AccessControl]] for more information on setting up access control lists for various
use cases.

---+++ Moderation

Moderating comments allows you a bit more control of which comments are approved to be okay to be displayed to the public.
This is mostly used on public environments to hide comments until they are approved by a list of moderators.
Only the original author and moderators will see unapproved comments. For everybody else, unapproved comments are hidden
until they are approved.

To enable moderation set the COMMENTMODERATION preference setting (defaults to off):

<verbatim>   * Set COMMENTMODERATION = on</verbatim>

The list of people allowed to moderate a comment is configured by using Foswiki's permission system using the MODERATE
role. So to configure moderators per topic use:

<verbatim>
   * Set ALLOWTOPICMODERATE = <comma separated list of users and/or groups>
   * Set DENYTOPICMODERATE = <comma separated list of users and/or groups>
</verbatim>

Or use a per web configuration in the !WebPreferences using 

<verbatim>
   * Set ALLOWWEBMODERATE = <comma separated list of users and/or groups>
   * Set DENYWEBMODERATE = <comma separated list of users and/or groups>
</verbatim>

See [[System.AccessControl][AccessControl]] for more information on setting up access control lists.
